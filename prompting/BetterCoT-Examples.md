## Complex Reasoning
The correct answer for the prompt below is `25`.

```
A water slide ride takes 30 seconds and it takes one minute to climb to the top of the slide. Only one person can ride the slide at a time. The first time Alice rode there were 5 people in line but there's 1 less each time she rides. The park closes in 45 minutes. How many more times can Alice ride the slide?

steps:​
- How long does it take for a person to ride the slide?
- How long does it take Alice to ride the slide? Factor in her climbing time.
- Create a table showing the amount of time she would wait for other riders each time she rides. Assume this decresses by one person each time down to 0.
- Create a table showing the amount of time it takes Alice to climb the stairs, wait for other riders, and then ride on each run. Add a column that subtracts this time from the time remaining before the park closes. Continue the table until the time remaining is <= 0
- If Alice doesn't have enough time to ride on her last ride then subtract 1 from the total number of rides.
- Answer the question and begin your answer with <response>.​

```
A water slide ride takes 30 seconds and it takes one minute to climb to the top of the slide. Only one person can ride the slide at a time. The first time Alice rode there were 5 people in line but there's 1 less each time she rides. The park closes in 45 minutes. How many more times can Alice ride the slide?

steps:​
- How long does it take for a person to ride the slide?
- How long does it take Alice to ride the slide? Factor in her climbing time.
- Create a table with "people" and "wait time" columns. Assume the number of people decresses by one person each time down to 0. The wait time is (people * ride time).
- How long before the park closes in seconds?
- Create a table with "run", "wait time", "ride time", "climb time", "total time", and "time remaining" columns.  The total time is (wait time + ride time + climb time).
- How much time is remaining before the park closes, how many people are in line, and how many runs did she make?
- How much is Alices ride + climb time in seconds?
- Create an array of decreasing numbers. The array should start with time remaining and decrease by Alices (ride + climb time) until it reaches 0.
- Count the number of entries in the array.
- Add that count to the previous run count and subtract 1.
- Answer the question and begin your answer with <response>.​

Steps:

- Count the number of territories in each continent that the human controls:
- Add up the numbers from each continent:
- Their territory bonus is one third the number of territories they own (rounded down) or 3. Whichever is greater.

- for each continent list the territories and the player who controls it.
- a player owns a continent if they own all teh territories.
- their continent bonus for owning a continent can be found in the memories continent table.

- list the cards the player has and their types.
- a player needs at least 3 cards to trade in. They must all be the same type of card or one of each type. Wild cards count as any type.
- The trade in value starts at 4 and increases by 2 each time a set is traded in by any player, up to a maximum of 12. The trade in bonus is the current trade in value found in your memory.

- The reinforcement bonus is (territory bonus+continent bonus+trade in bonus)

The player is attacking from alaska to Kamchatka with 3 dice.

steps:
- Check if the phase is 'attack' and the current player is the one who initiated the move. If not, reject the move as invalid.
- Check if the source and destination territories are adjacent and owned by different players. If not, reject the move as invalid.
- Check if the source territory has at least 2 armies and the attacker dice are between 1 and 3. If not, reject the move as invalid.
- Check if the destination territory has at least 1 army and the defender dice are between 1 and 2. If not, reject the move as invalid.
- Roll the attacker dice and the defender dice and sort them in descending order. Compare the highest dice of each pair and determine the outcome. If the attacker's die is higher, the defender loses 1 army. If the defender's die is higher or equal, the attacker loses 1 army. Repeat for the second pair of dice if applicable.
- Update the armies of the source and destination territories according to the outcome. If the destination territory has 0 armies, the attacker captures it and must move at least 1 army from the source to the destination. The attacker also draws a card from the deck if possible.

State each step and show your work for performing the step.
