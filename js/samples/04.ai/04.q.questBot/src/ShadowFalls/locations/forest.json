    "details": "The ancient forest of Shadowwood is a sprawling wilderness full of tall trees and thick foliage. The forest is home to many animals and plants, some of which have magical properties or are sacred to the Zalari. The forest also hides some of the Zalari's secrets, such as hidden shrines, stone carvings, and portals. The forest is a source of food, medicine, and materials for the villagers of Shadow Falls, who respect and protect the forest and its inhabitants. The forest is also a source of adventure and danger for the villagers, who often encounter wild beasts, traps, and puzzles in the forest. The forest is also a source of mystery and wonder for the villagers, who sometimes hear strange noises, see glowing lights, or feel a presence in the forest. To the north is the village of Shadow Falls, a friendly and welcoming place, where the villagers are descendants of the Zalari. To the south is the Cave of the Ancients, a hidden and treacherous place, filled with strange echoes and whispers, where the Zalari used to explore other dimensions, realities, and possibilities.",
