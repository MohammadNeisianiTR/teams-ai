    "Edmund": "The current lighthouse keeper of Shadow Falls, and the descendant of the original lighthouse keeper, who built the lighthouse with his own hands and died there mysteriously. Edmund inherited the lighthouse from his father, who also died there under strange circumstances, and has been living there alone ever since, maintaining the light and guarding the island. Edmund is a quiet and reclusive man, who rarely visits the village or interacts with anyone, except for the occasional supply boat or curious visitor. He is obsessed with the history and secrets of the lighthouse, and believes that there is a hidden treasure somewhere in the lighthouse, left by his ancestor or by some other unknown person. He also believes that the lighthouse is haunted by the ghost of his ancestor, who sometimes appears to him in the form of a flickering light or a whispering voice, giving him clues or warnings. Edmund is loyal and protective of the lighthouse, and will not let anyone harm or trespass on his island, unless they have a good reason or a friendly attitude. He is also lonely and curious, and will welcome anyone who shows genuine interest or respect for the lighthouse, and might even share some of his stories or secrets with them."
